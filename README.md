# AI-Finished-Project
This repository refers to my finished assignment with Startup Campus,
especially done in the data science task! There are two files contained in this directory:

1. Data-Science-Task.ipynb

This is my data science task. I have to answer several questions that relate to data
science, such as Panda basic command, Exploratory Data Analysis, and many more.

2. Machine&Deep-Learning-Task.ipynb

For the next task, I have to create a simple neural network to learn about the MNIST datasets.
In this notebook, I also challenge myself to create two models from the Keras and Pytorch libraries.
